from laptop we need 3 aspects from the image.

1. is there a line within x numbers of pixels from image centre? (meaning are we about to drive over the line?)
2. is the detected ball at the bottom of the image frame? (using the xyxy stored make up a minimum pixel distance from bottom at which we believe we have arrived at ball)
3. error of ball from centreline? (how many pixels horizontally from centreline is the ball? positive 100 is 100 pixels to right of image centre, -20 is 20 pixels to the left)
